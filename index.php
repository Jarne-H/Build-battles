                        In the current buildbattle, you have to build a castle in the style/shape of any Minecraft-related mob.
                        Mobs from mob votes are also included. What exactly qualifies as a castle is up to you.
                        It can be a mansion, palace, casual castle, bastion surrounded by a castle wall,...
                        <br><br>
